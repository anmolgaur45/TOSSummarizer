# TOSSummarizer
We are working on a Machine Learning-based model in which our dataset will be the data of Terms and Condition and our model will be extracting the important terms that reader or user should know about and will form a kind of summary from the data(contract) provided. The reason of working on this model is that many users don't always read the terms and condition before using a particular application and just check the box of "agreed" and go ahead, so our model will sort the important and red flags, advantages and disadvantages of terms from the dataset and will show it to the user. A lot of more valuable things will also be added in the model to make it more useful as how long the owner want the summary to be shown to the user.
